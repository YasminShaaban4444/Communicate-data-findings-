1-The structure of dataset:

30803 rows and 22 columns 

2- The main features of interest in dataset:

arr_flights , weather_ct,nas_ct,security_ct,arr_flights
  
3-The features in the dataset that  help to support investigation into the features of interest:

carrier_name,airport_name,year


4-The distribution of variables of interest:

Left Skewed distribution of number of flights , number of flights delayed due to weather and number of flights delayed due to National Aviation System
There are outliers in weather ct between 17500 and 20000.

5-Skywest is a North American regional airline  , it is the most used airline.


6-It seems it is slightly positive correlation between number of flights delayed due to security , this can be because when there is care about security number of flights increases 


7- I think that number of flights in 2019  will be less than that in 2020 because of COVID19 but surprizingly flights in 2020 tend to be more 
 Allegiant Air is an American low-cost airline shows the largest number of flights


8-I want to see the relationship between number of flights delayed due to weather and number of flights delayed due to National Aviation System it seems it is a positive correlation in both year 2019 and 2020

9-The relationships between features 
it seems it is a positive correlation in both year 2019 and 2020 between weather_ct and nas_ct 
it seems it is a positive correlation in both year 2019 and 2020 between number of flights and weather_ct 


10-It is interseting  that the relation between arr_flights and weather_ct is positive correlation ,
number of flights delayed due to weather is positive correlated with the number of flights delayed due to weather  this can be 
because when there is care about weather circumstances and care of  national aviation  system , number of flights increases
